The connector waits for the length of time specified in the <a href=\"02-configuring-connector-types-and-properties.md#retry-interval-on-error\">Retry Interval on Error</a> and then tries to get the changed entries in the database again. After the maximum number of retries (indicated in the <a href=\"02-configuring-connector-types-and-properties.md#max-retries-on-error\">Max Retries on Error</a> property) is exhausted, if the SQL syntax is still invalid, the connector stops. You must either remove or correct the SQL filter before restarting the connector. It is recommended that you set the connector <a href=\"02-configuring-connector-types-and-properties.md#log-level\">Log Level</a> to DEBUG and check the connector log for the SQL query (\"Executing query:\") that is generated to ensure the value entered in the <code class=\"language-text\">SQL Filter</code> property is translated properly.

Sometimes rows in the log table are not written in the order of the change ID, and if the connector doesn't wait for the entries to have sequential IDs, some changes could be missed.
