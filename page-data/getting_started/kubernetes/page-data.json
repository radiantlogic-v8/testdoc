Radiant Logic provides DevOps images for deployments on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).</p>\n<h2 id=\"deployment\">Deployment</h2>\n<h3 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>Before deploying RadiantOne, you should already be familiar with Kubernetes Pods, Services and StatefulSets. See the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/\">Kubernetes Documentation</a> for details. You should also be familiar with Kubernetes kubectl commands. See the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/\">Kubernetes Cheat Sheet</a> for details.</p>\n<p>In addition, you should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have a supported Kubernetes cluster running in the cloud. A commonly deployed Kubernetes cluster is <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCluster.html\">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a highly available architecture, the underlying Kubernetes cluster should support at least two pods running RadiantOne nodes and three pods running ZooKeeper.\n<br>\n<br>\n<mark>Note - Kubernetes v1.18+ is required. The pods running RadiantOne nodes need at least 2 CPUs and 4 GiB memory. The pods running ZK need at least 2 CPUs and 2 GiB memory.</mark><br></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Install and configure the Kubernetes kubectl command-line tool on the machine where you will manage the Kubernetes cluster from.  This utility controls the Kubernetes Cluster. An example is <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html\">AWS CLI</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have a RadiantOne configuration exported from a Linux Dev/QA environment. After installing RadiantOne in the Kubernetes cluster, you can import the configuration and make any needed configuration updates from the RadiantOne Main Control Panel or from command line using the vdsconfig utility.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"manifest-files\">Manifest Files</h3>\n<p>Download the StatefulSet manifests: configmap.yaml, fid-aws.yaml and zk-aws.yaml, on the machine where you will manage the Kubernetes cluster from. Contact Radiant Logic at <a href=\"mailto:support@radiantlogic.com\">support@radiantlogic.com</a> for access to these files.</p>\n<h4 id=\"zookeeper\">Zookeeper</h4>\n<p>The StatefulSet manifest, zk-aws.yaml, creates a ZooKeeper cluster that consists of three Pods by default. Although the Kubernetes web console can be used to create new stateful sets, the steps below leverage the kubectl command line tool. Perform the following steps on the machine where you have downloaded the kubectl command line utilty and saved the yaml files.</p>\n<h5 id=\"installation\">Installation</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Update zk-aws.yaml file if necessary.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can modify the ZooKeeper ports, number of nodes (ZOOKEEPER_FLEET_SIZE) in the ensemble (3 is the default, but you can make it 5 if needed), name of the Kubernetes service linked to the ZooKeeper nodes (make sure this matches what is defined in the configmap.yaml).\n<br>\n<mark>Note – Do not use “TABS” for spacing in the .yaml file.  Use the space bar to indent as needed.</mark>\n<br>\n2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the location where you have installed the kubectl command line tool.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Create the ZooKeeper StatefulSet from the zk.yaml. Indicate the path to the ZooKeeper yaml file. In the example shown below, it is located in the same location at the kubectl tool.</li>\n</ol>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>kubectl --namespace=prod apply -f zk-aws.yaml</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">kubectl --namespace=prod apply -f zk-aws.yaml</code></pre></div>\n<br>\n<mark>Note – if no namespace is used in the Kubernetes cluster, you can omit the\n--namespace property.</mark>\n<br>\n<h5 id=\"validating-the-zookeeper-service\">Validating the ZooKeeper Service</h5>\n<p>Before installing RadiantOne nodes, make sure the ZooKeeper service is running. There should be one leader node and two follower nodes (if you kept the default fleet size of 3). The steps in this section describe how to do this from the Kubernetes cluster web dashboard.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the Kubernetes web dashboard, navigate to Workloads -> Stateful Sets.</li>\n<li>Click the Stateful Set corresponding to your ZooKeeper deployment.</li>\n<li>In the Pods section, click zk-0 (in this example the name used in the ZooKeeper yaml is “zk”).</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<img src=\"../img/kubernetesdashboard.jpg\" alt=\"Kubernetes Dashboard\" style=\"height: 250px; width:1000px;\"/>\n<br>\n4. Click ->EXEC, this opens a new browser window.\n5.

The results are shown below.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<img src=\"../img/followerzk2.jpg\" alt=\"Follower ZK Node 2\" style=\"height: 150px; width:1000px;\"/>\n<br>\n<img src=\"../img/leaderzk.jpg\" alt=\"Leader ZK Node\" style=\"height: 125px; width:1000px;\"/>\n<br>\n<h5 id=\"checking-the-zookeeper-service-via-http\">Checking the ZooKeeper Service via HTTP</h5>\n<p>In the example commands used in this section, the ZooKeeper service is named “myzk” and the shell is launched for the pod named myzk-2.\nRun the following to see the commands available:</p>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>curl http://myzk:8080/commands</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">curl http://myzk:8080/commands</code></pre></div>\n<p>A couple of examples are shown below.\n<br>\nWhen “ruok” returns “error” : null, this means the ZooKeeper node is running fine.\n<br>\nWhen “is_read_only” returns “read_only” : false, this means the ZooKeeper node is not in a read-only state. If a ZooKeeper node is in a read-only state, something is wrong and the RadiantOne nodes will not allow any write operations during this time. Most likely ZooKeeper has lost the quorum and can’t communicate with more than half of the other ZooKeeper nodes.\n<br>\n<img src=\"../img/zookeepercheck.jpg\" alt=\"ZooKeeper State Check\" style=\"height: 150px; width:500px;\"/>\n<br></p>\n<h4 id=\"radiantone-nodes\">RadiantOne Nodes</h4>\n<p>The StatefulSet manifests (configmap.yaml and fid.yaml) create a RadiantOne node. After the node is deployed, you can scale up the number of nodes as needed. Although the Kubernetes web console can be used to create new stateful sets, the steps below leverage the kubectl command line tool. Perform the following steps on the machine where you have downloaded the kubectl command line utilty and saved the yaml files.</p>\n<h5 id=\"installation-1\">Installation</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Update the <a href=\"configmapyaml.md\">configmap.yaml</a> file.</li>\n<li>Update the <a href=\"fidyaml.md\">fid-aws.yaml</a> file.</li>\n<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the location where you installed the kubectl command line utilty.</li>\n<li>To create the RadiantOne FID StatefulSet, you can reference the folder that contains both the configmap.yaml and fid-aws.yaml files.

Kubernetes scales down to one node.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n{==Note – you must scale down instead of just stopping the RadiantOne services on the nodes. Stopping the services would result in Kubernetes trying to restart them.  By default, when Kubernetes scales down the nodes, they still remain a part of the cluster. If you run cluster.sh list, you still see the nodes, but the RadiantOne services will not be running. This way, Kubernetes does not try to restart the RadiantOne services automatically.==}\n<br>\n8. From the machine where the kubectl utility is installed, copy the file that was exported from the dev/qa environment to the RadiantOne leader node (the example below has a RadiantOne node identified as fid-0 in the demo namespace).\n```\nkubectl cp export.zip fid-0:/opt/radiantone -n demo\n```\n9. (Optional) If you want to customize additional configuration changes to be executed after the initial configuration is imported, create a script named [configure_fid.sh](postmigrationscript.md) that contains the needed commands (e.g. update host information in data sources to point to production instances). This script is executed by the migration process after the initial configuration is imported (in step #10 below).\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>From the machine where the kubectl utility is installed, run the import command on the target pod.</li>\n</ol>\n\n          <codeblockcopytag>kubectl exec -it fid-0 -n demo -- ./migrate.sh import export.zip</codeblockcopytag>\n          \n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">kubectl exec -it fid-0 -n demo -- ./migrate.sh import export.zip</code></pre></div>\n<p>The migrate script stops the RadiantOne services on the target pod, and then restarts them after import.</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>Scale up the RadiantOne nodes from the Kubernetes web dashboard -> Workloads -> Stateful Sets.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"administration\">Administration</h2>\n<h3 id=\"scaling-out---adding-radiantone-nodes\">Scaling Out - Adding RadiantOne Nodes</h3>\n<p>Scaling out means adding RadiantOne nodes to the cluster.

This is dictated by the <code class=\"language-text\">type: NodePort</code> keyword in the .yaml file that describes the RadiantOne FID LDAP ports.</p>\n<p>{==Note - If you changed the .yaml file prior to deploying, and set <code class=\"language-text\">type: LoadBalancer</code>, then clients would access RadiantOne FID via LDAP through an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).==}</p>\n<p>From the Kubernetes web console, navigate to Discovery and Load Balancing -> Services. You can see the service name and port (LDAP port 2389 by default) in the section matching the label you defined for the RadiantOne deployment. An example is shown below.\n<br>\n<img src=\"../img/lbservice.jpg\" alt=\"Load Balancer Service\" style=\"height: 400px; width:1000px;\"/>\n<br></p>\n<h4 id=\"using-web-services-scim-dsmlspml-rest\">Using Web Services (SCIM, DSML/SPML, REST)</h4>\n<p>From the Kubernetes web dashboard, navigate to Discovery and Load Balancing -> Services.</p>\n<p>The external endpoints, which point to the AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) that is in front of the RadiantOne services, are shown. There are four external endpoints configured. Two point to the Control Panel (one is for the non-ssl port and the other is for the ssl port). Two point to the RadiantOne web services (SCIM, DSML/SPML, REST/ADAP) ports. Hover over the endpoint to see the server and port. Give this information to clients to connect to RadiantOne on the web services ports.</p>\n<p><mark>Note - You can map the ELB endpoint to a friendly DNS name by creating a Hosted Zone in AWS.</mark></p>\n<h3 id=\"applying-radiantone-patches\">Applying RadiantOne Patches</h3>\n<p>Patching a version of RadiantOne is classified as an update. Patch versions are identified by the 3rd number in the whole version. For example, v7.3.10 indicates it is the 10th patch release for v7.3.\nYou can apply a patch, and update to a newer patch release (e.g. apply a patch on v7.3.10 to update to v7.3.11).</p>\n<p>Patches are not for upgrading to a new version (e.g. moving from v7.3 to v7.4), or moving from a newer patch release to an older patch release (e.g. moving from v7.3.10 to v7.3.8).</p>\n<p>The following requirements must be met in order to update/patch the RadiantOne version on the RadiantOne nodes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ZooKeeper ensemble must be reachable and not in a read-only state.</li>\n<li>There must be at least two nodes in the RadiantOne cluster. The process performs a rolling update where each RadiantOne node is updated at a time. While one RadiantOne node is being updated, the other node must be available to serve client requests.</li>\n<li>Although a rolling update does not require the complete RadiantOne service to be offline (at least one node should always be available), throughput will be reduced as nodes are being updated. Therefore, it is recommended that you patch during maintenance windows/non-peak hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a container is started, it pulls the image specified in the yaml file and Kubernetes checks the version that is installed. If the current version is less than the version outlined in the yaml file, it knows that the image needs to be updated.  In this case, the update.sh file is run and one RadiantOne node is updated at a time.</p>\n<p>The steps to apply a patch are outlined below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From the Kubernetes web dashboard -> Workloads -> Stateful Sets, click the 3 dots next to the one representing the RadiantOne node.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click View/edit YAML.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<img src=\"../img/edityaml.jpg\" alt=\"Edit YAML\" style=\"height: 200px; width:1000px;\"/>\n<br>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Update the image version in the fid-aws.yaml file to indicate a newer patch version of RadiantOne.

This can take quite a bit of time to perform. Stateful sets are updated in order from the highest number to the lowest number. For three RadiantOne nodes, the fid-2 node is updated first, followed by the fid-1 node and finally the fid-0 node. The pod gets stopped and the latest image (indicated in the yaml file) is compared to the current version of RadiantOne on the node. If the current version is less than the version specified in the yaml, then the RadiantOne update process is executed on the node. This process is logged in the RadiantOne logs on the node. You can acces the logs from the Kubernetes web dashboard -> Workloads -> Pods -> <RadiantOne pod> by clicking LOGS.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"../img/logs.jpg\" alt=\"Logs\" style=\"height: 75px; width:1000px;\"/>\n<br></p>\n<p>An example of the log is shown below.\n<br>\n<img src=\"../img/logcontents.jpg\" alt=\"Log Contents\" style=\"height: 300px; width:1000px;\"/>\n<br></p>\n<p><mark>Note – A backup of the existing install is made to vds-<version>.tar prior to updating.</mark></p>\n<h3 id=\"deleting-deployments\">Deleting Deployments</h3>\n<p>To remove a deployment, delete the stateful sets, services, config maps, persistent volumes, and persistent volume claims.</p>\n<h4 id=\"delete-stateful-sets\">Delete Stateful Sets</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>From the Kubernetes Control Panel -> Overview -> Stateful Sets section, click the 3 dots next to the RadiantOne FID stateful set (in the example shown below, this is the one named fid738) and choose Delete.
